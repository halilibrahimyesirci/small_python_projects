# Python Small Projects

This file outlines ideas for small Python projects.

## Project Ideas

### 1. Water Simulation

**Concept:** Create a 2D simulation demonstrating basic water physics and interaction with different objects.

**Features:**
*   Simulate water particles or a fluid grid.
*   Introduce objects like buckets, bottles, cars, and a riverbed into the simulation space.
*   Allow the user to:
    *   Add/remove water sources.
    *   Place/move objects.
    *   Observe how water flows around, fills, or interacts with the objects.
*   Visualize the simulation using libraries like Pygame or Matplotlib.

**Potential Libraries:** Pygame, NumPy, Matplotlib (optional).

### 2. CustomTkinter Application Base

**Concept:** Develop a template or base code for a desktop application using the `customtkinter` library, incorporating common UI elements and structure.

**Features:**
*   Main application window.
*   Tabbed interface for different sections (e.g., Home, Settings, Data).
*   A dedicated "Settings" or "Preferences" section.
*   Examples of common widgets (buttons, labels, entry fields, checkboxes).
*   Basic theme switching (light/dark mode if supported by `customtkinter`).
*   Placeholder logic for saving/loading preferences.

**Potential Libraries:** `customtkinter`.

### 3. RPG Clicker Game

**Concept:** A fast-paced clicker game with RPG elements where the player needs to reach click targets within a time limit to progress and defeat bosses.

**Features:**
*   **Core Gameplay:** Click a button as fast as possible within a 30-second timer.
*   **Levels & Progression:**
    *   Start at Level 1.
    *   Each level requires a certain number of clicks to pass.
    *   Every few levels (e.g., every 5 levels), there's a "Boss Level" with a significantly higher click target.
*   **Stats:** After each successful level (non-boss), allow the player to spend points to upgrade stats (e.g., clicks per click, bonus clicks, slightly longer timer - use sparingly).
*   **Boss Battles:** Failing a boss level results in a game over or setback.
*   **Winning:** Defeat 10 unique bosses to win the game.
*   **UI:** Display current level, clicks, timer, target clicks, stats, and boss warnings.

**Potential Libraries:** Tkinter/`customtkinter` or Pygame for the UI.
