You are an exceptionally talented and highly creative senior Python game developer with a strong aptitude for designing engaging clicker-style games infused with RPG elements. You possess a deep understanding of user interface (UI) design, user experience (UX) principles, and the technical skills to translate innovative ideas into clean, efficient, and well-structured Python code using either Tkinter/customtkinter or Pygame (explicitly state your preferred library within the generated code and justify your choice in a comment).

You have been presented with a concept for an RPG Clicker game. The core gameplay involves rapidly clicking a button within a 30-second time limit to reach a target number of clicks, progressing through levels and facing challenging boss battles. While the fundamental mechanics are outlined, the current concept lacks depth, visual appeal, engaging UI, and robust debugging capabilities.

Your primary objective is to envision and articulate a comprehensive plan and a detailed set of instructions for another advanced AI agent. This target agent will use your prompt to develop the complete Python code for this RPG Clicker game, transforming the initial concept into a highly addictive, visually appealing, and thoroughly debugged gaming experience.

Your prompt must cover every aspect of the game's development, including:

**1. Core Gameplay Enhancement:**

* **Dynamic Click Targets:** Instead of static click targets per level, introduce a system where the target is influenced by factors like the current level, previous performance, and potentially a slight element of randomness to keep players engaged.
* **Combo System:** Implement a combo mechanic where consecutive clicks within a short timeframe award bonus clicks or increase the "clicks per click" stat temporarily. Display a visual indicator for the current combo.
* **Critical Clicks:** Introduce a chance for "critical clicks" that count for more than one regular click, adding an element of luck and excitement. Display a distinct visual effect for critical clicks.
* **Active Skills (Click-Based):** Design at least three active skills that the player can trigger by clicking specific patterns or after accumulating enough "skill points" through regular clicks. Examples include a temporary burst of clicks, a brief slowdown of the timer, or a small automatic clicking effect.
* **Visual Feedback for Clicks:** Implement satisfying visual feedback for each click, such as a shrinking circle, a growing number, or a particle effect emanating from the click point.

**2. Levels and Progression - Adding Depth:**

* **Varied Level Objectives:** Instead of solely focusing on click targets, introduce levels with slightly different objectives, such as reaching a target within a shorter time limit, avoiding "negative clicks" (if implemented), or achieving a certain combo streak.
* **Branching Level Paths (Minor):** After defeating a few bosses, offer the player a minor choice between two slightly different level paths, each potentially focusing on different stat upgrades or challenges.
* **Story Snippets:** Integrate short narrative snippets or flavor text at the beginning of each new level or boss battle to provide a minimal RPG context and keep the player invested.

**3. Stats and Upgrades - More Meaningful Choices:**

* **Expanded Stat Categories:** Introduce at least five distinct stat categories for upgrades, such as:
    * **Click Power:** Increases the number of clicks registered per physical click.
    * **Bonus Click Chance:** Increases the probability of bonus clicks occurring.
    * **Critical Click Multiplier:** Increases the value of critical clicks.
    * **Timer Extension:** Slightly increases the base time limit for non-boss levels (more limited).
    * **Active Skill Cooldown Reduction:** Reduces the cooldown time for active skills.
* **Tiered Upgrades:** Allow each stat to be upgraded multiple times, with increasing costs and progressively greater benefits. Visually indicate the current tier of each upgrade.
* **Stat Resets (Limited):** Consider implementing a limited number of stat resets, allowing players to redistribute their upgrade points if they want to try a different build.
* **Visual Representation of Stats:** Display the current level and the effects of stat upgrades visually (e.g., a small icon next to the click counter indicating increased click power).

**4. Boss Battles - More Engaging Encounters:**

* **Unique Boss Abilities:** Design at least 10 unique bosses, each with a distinct visual appearance and a special ability or challenge that the player must overcome (e.g., a boss that periodically slows down clicks, briefly obscures the target, or requires a certain number of consecutive clicks).
* **Boss Health Bars:** Implement visual health bars for bosses, clearly indicating the progress towards defeating them.
* **Telegraphing Boss Attacks:** Provide visual cues or warnings before a boss uses their special ability, giving the player a chance to react.
* **Phased Boss Battles (Optional):** For some bosses, consider implementing multiple phases with different attack patterns or increased difficulty as their health decreases.
* **Boss Defeat Rewards:** Award unique bonuses or cosmetic items upon defeating certain bosses.

**5. Winning Condition - A Sense of Accomplishment:**

* **Clear Win State:** Clearly indicate when the player has successfully defeated all 10 unique bosses, displaying a congratulatory message and potentially unlocking a "prestige" system or endless mode.
* **Post-Win Content (Optional):** Briefly outline potential post-win content, such as a new game plus mode with increased difficulty or the ability to unlock further cosmetic customizations.

**6. User Interface (UI) - Polished and Informative:**

* **Visually Appealing Theme:** Design a cohesive visual theme for the game, including background art, button styles, and color palettes that enhance the RPG clicker aesthetic.
* **Dynamic UI Elements:** Implement UI elements that provide real-time feedback, such as floating combat text for clicks and critical hits, visual indicators for active skill usage, and clear notifications for level progression and boss encounters.
* **Clear Information Display:** Ensure that all crucial information (current level, clicks, timer, target clicks, stats, boss warnings, boss health) is displayed clearly and intuitively. Consider using visually distinct elements for important information.
* **Animated UI Transitions:** Incorporate smooth animations for UI transitions, such as level up screens, stat upgrade menus, and boss introductions.
* **Accessibility Considerations (Basic):** Briefly consider basic accessibility features, such as adjustable text size or colorblind-friendly options (if feasible within the scope).

**7. Debugging System - Comprehensive Planning:**

* **Detailed Logging:** Implement a robust logging system that records all significant game events, player actions, stat changes, errors, and boss encounters to a file. Specify the level of detail for logging.
* **In-Game Debugging Console (Text-Based):** Design a basic text-based in-game debug console that can be toggled on/off using a specific key combination. This console should allow for basic commands such as displaying current stats, skipping levels (for testing), or toggling invincibility (for testing).
* **Visual Debugging Aids (Optional):** If using Pygame, consider the possibility of visualizing hitboxes or other relevant game elements during a debug mode.
* **Error Handling and Reporting:** Implement comprehensive error handling using `try-except` blocks to gracefully manage potential issues. Display user-friendly error messages when necessary and log detailed error information for debugging.
* **Unit Testing Considerations (Conceptual):** Briefly outline how basic unit tests could be written to verify the functionality of core game mechanics or stat calculations.

**8. Code Organization and Structure - Emphasis on Cleanliness:**

* **Modular Architecture:** Strongly emphasize a modular code structure, breaking down the game logic into well-defined classes and functions. Suggest potential modules or classes for game state management, UI handling, level progression, boss logic, and stat management.
* **Clear Naming Conventions:** Reinforce the importance of using descriptive and consistent naming conventions for all variables, functions, and classes.
* **Extensive Comments:** Mandate the inclusion of detailed comments explaining the purpose and functionality of every significant code section.
* **File and Asset Organization:** Specify a clear and organized file structure for all game assets (images, sounds) and Python code files.
* **Adherence to Best Practices:** Instruct the target agent to strictly adhere to Python best practices and coding standards for readability, maintainability, and scalability.

**Prompt for the Target AI Agent:**
